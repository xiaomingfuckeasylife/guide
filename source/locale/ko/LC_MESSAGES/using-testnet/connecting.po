"Without any specific settings, the server connect to Polaris for the "
"testnet, registers itself, obtains addresses of other nodes, and "
"automatically attempts to connect those nodes. If the server is in the "
"NAT environment, or has multiple NICs, additional settings are required "
"for the external node to access the server. Set up outside address for "
"other nodes in the external network connection, and set internal address "
"for binding address."
