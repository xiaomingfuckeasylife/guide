msgid ""
"The objective of all blockchain protocols is to replicate a blockchain "
"and its associated state across participating nodes. To achieve such an "
"agreement, each blockchain protocol deploys a consensus algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:8
msgid ""
"The public Aergo network uses **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** for "
"blockchain consensus."
msgstr ""

msgid "BP Election"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:12
msgid ""
"In DPoS, blocks are generated only by a limited number of nodes called "
"Block Producers (BPs). BPs are elected via voting, where the voting power"
" is weighted by staked tokens."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:16
msgid ""
"BPs are re-elected round by round (blocks per round = the total number of"
" the BPs). In each round, time is split into slots and each slot is "
"assigned to one of the elected BPs. Only the permitted BP can produce a "
"block in a time slot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Staking & Voting"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:22
msgid ""
"Staking means locking up one's tokens for a minimum period of time. Any "
"user wanting to vote must stake their tokens since the voting power is "
"weighted by the number of staked tokens, as remarked above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:26
msgid ""
"Voting is performed via a transaction. Voting results do not come into "
"effect immediately. The current BPs are elected based on the voting "
"result gathered at the block number: (<current block number> / <the total"
" number of BPs> - 1) * <the total number of BPs>."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:31
msgid ""
"In other words, the voting results gathered in the past (approximately 1 "
"round before) are used for stability (recent blocks may be roll-backed "
"via a reorganization)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:35
msgid ""
"Votes are locked for a certain period of time to prevent users from "
"spamming votes. On the public Aergo network, this is currently approx. 1 "
"day. That means, after casting a vote, a user can only change their vote "
"after 1 day has passed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Last Irreversible Block (LIB)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:40
msgid ""
"In some blockchain protocols, a blockchain may branch into two or more, "
"which is called a fork. Later, only one of them is chosen as the main "
"branch via a set of rules defined by the protocol. Such reorganizations "
"limit each block's finality and, in turn, transaction's finality. For "
"example, a transaction, included in a block at one time, might be "
"rejected later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/specs/consensus.rst:47
msgid ""
"DPoS also allows blockchain forks. However, a block becomes a last "
"irreversible block (LIB) when it is (double time) confirmed by a majority"
" (2/3+) of BPs. Once a block is determined as a LIB, it cannot be rolled "
"back, i.e. it achieves finality."
